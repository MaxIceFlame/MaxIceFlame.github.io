## Trivia
* The achievement of Ocean was originally named as "Dive into the deep", and was later changed to "The lost Atlantis". It's a homage to the lyric "Where are you now? -Atlantis." in Alan Walker's song ["Faded"](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=36990266)
* The Chinese achievement name of Dreamer actually came from the level's English title "Dreamer". It's also the name of the song used in the level
* In Chinese, the name of the achievement of School came from a poem written by the level designer lyckay when designing the level
* After the official version of [Space](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ex4y117sm) had been released, many players called this level "Bonus of The Chaos", so the achievement of Space was named as "Is it…The Chaos?"
* The achievement of The Discovery - Chronos is "Reborn from the ashes", which seems to have no relation to the level, is closely connected to the process that the level was removed and was remade then released again
* The achievement of Desert Maze is "Maze escaper", which has nothing to do with the level's actual content, is supposed that it's insinuating something
* The achievement of Chemistry is "He Zn Tm". Actually, He, Zn and Tm are the preceding elements of Li, Ga and Yb, respectively. Li Ga Yb used to use this name as his name
* The achievement of Fireworks, "Summer festival line", came from a food called "Summer Festival Fish" in Genshin Impact
* The achievement of Mathematics, "Tool subject", came from a joke told by game producer's physics teacher in class
* The achievement of Jupiter, "Fa, Fake diamonds!", is actually an answer to the question "What are on the Jupiter?" in the title of the official video
* The achievement of Food Party, "Delicacy Temptation", came from a level named "Delicacy Temptation" in Rolling Sky
* The secret achievement of Ocean, "Lifeless ocean", is actually a joke told by players because there are no fishes and other sea creatures in ocean
